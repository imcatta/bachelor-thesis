Objectives and principles for the design of these systems are derived from legal principles, economic theory, and theories of reliable and secure protocols. Similarities and differences between smart contracts and traditional business procedures based on written contracts, controls, and static forms are discussed. By using cryptographic and other security mechanisms, we can secure many algorithmically specifiable relationships from breach by principals, and from eavesdropping or malicious interference by third parties, up to considerations of time, user interface, and completeness of the algorithmic specification. This article discusses protocols with application in important contracting areas, including credit, content rights management, payment systems, and contracts with bearer.},

This problem was recently re-investigated by Blake and Chan who showed a scalable non-interactive solution without considering a formal security model. We fill this gap by introducing a new stringent model tailored to the non-interactive setting. We then propose a new construction fitting our model and we show that it is more efficient than the recent non-interactive proposal (for which we also give a security proof in our model). We then explain how to provide our scheme and the one of Blake and Chan with an additional security property that strengthens the anonymity of receivers.",

Previous constructions for this task were either based on heuristic assumptions or did not provide anonymity to the sender of the message. In the public-key setting, we present an efficient and secure timed-release encryption scheme using a ``time server'' which inputs the current time into the system. The server has to only interact with the receiver and never learns the sender's identity. The scheme's computational and communicational cost per request are only logarithmic in the time parameter. The construction of our scheme is based on a novel cryptographic primitive: a variant of oblivious transfer which we call conditional oblivious transfer. We define this primitive (which may be of independent interest) and show an efficient construction for an instance of this new primitive based on the quadratic residuosity assumption.",

Next, we introduce the concept of an authenticated timed-release cryptosystem, briefly consider generic constructions, and then give a construction based on a single primitive which is efficient and provably secure.",

In (Plain) TSE, a Time Server broadcasts a key at the beginning of each time unit, a Time Instant Key (TIK). The sender of a message can specify any time interval during the encryption process; the receiver can decrypt to recover the message only if it has a TIK that corresponds to a time in that interval. We extend Plain TSE to the public-key and identity-based settings, where receivers are additionally equipped with private keys and either public keys or identities, and where decryption now requires the use of the private key as well as an appropriate TIK. We introduce security models for the plain, public-key and identity-based settings. We also provide constructions for schemes in the different settings, showing how to obtain Plain TSE using identity-based techniques, how to combine Plain TSE with public-key and identity-based encryption schemes, and how to build schemes that are chosen-ciphertext secure from schemes that are chosen-plaintext secure. Finally, we suggest applications for our new primitive, and discuss its relationships with existing primitives, such as Timed-Release Encryption and Broadcast Encryption.",
